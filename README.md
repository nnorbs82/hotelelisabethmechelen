# Hotel Elisabeth website

The approved redesign is the main website at https://hotelelisabethmechelen.com/.
GitHub Pages serves the generated production files from the root of `main`.

Edit website source in `redesign-site/`; Pages CMS continues to use `.pages.yml`.
Run `python3 tools/promote_production_site.py` to rebuild content and publish the
production pages, assets and SEO files to the repository root. Never pass the
repository root to `build_production_site.py`, which clears its output directory.
The rebuild workflow automatically updates production files after source or CMS
changes on `main` and requests a Pages rebuild after its generated commit.

All booking bars use the shared promotion-code handler. Search and Check
availability submit the same dates, guest counts, language and `mewsVoucherCode`
(including an empty code) to the Mews booking engine.
